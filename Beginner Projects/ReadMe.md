Problem: 1 | Union of sets
Implement a function that finds union of two sets. You can assume that the sets
are stored using arrays. So, if array1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,3,2} and array2 is {1,3,5,7}, then
array3 should be {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. Note array3 should not have any duplicate elements. You
have to:
think of all the functions that are required for this problem. Each function should perform
its dedicated task. So, plan them out before implementing them.
Main should only have a set of function calls.

Problem: 2 | Matrix Multiplication.
Write a C Program to Perform Matrix Multiplication.
1. The program takes two matrices and multiplies them
2. If number of columns of matrix A is not equal to number of rows of matrix B, then
matrices cannot be added.
3. The program is exited.
4. Else they are multiplied and the result is printed.
5. Exit.

Problem: 3 | GPA Calculator
Build a GPA calculator that inputs grades of N number of different subjects along with
the credit hours from the user and displays the user’s GPA. The input grades and their
corresponding grading points are given below.
Grade Points
A 4.0
A- 3.67
B+ 3.33
B 3.0
B- 2.67
C+ 2.33
C 2.0
C- 1.67
D+ 1.33
D 1.0
F 0

The formula is
GPA = (GP1 * CH1 + GP2 * CH2 +......+ GPN * CHN)/ (CH1 + CH2 +.......+ CHN)
Where GP1 is Points of Subject 1 and CH1 show credit hours of subject 1.

Problem: 4 | Restaurant Menu
Write a C program that display the menu of restaurant. Ask the user to choose the item from the menu
list i-e Espresso, over Ice , fusion etc. let’s assume user have selected over ice option show the menu
along with the prices for regular as well as small. Ask for the item name, size, and quantity. After that
your program should ask again choose the item from the menu list 1-e Espresso, over Ice, fusion etc.
and keep choosing until user press N or enter no. Once user done with the menu display the total bill
that includes the total price and tax along with service charge.

Problem: 5
Given two arrays of strings a1 and a2 return a sorted array r in lexicographical order of the
strings of a1 which are substrings of strings of a2.
You have to create a function named:
void sorted_array(char arr1[5][10], char arr2[5][10], char r[5][10]);
that will populate the array r by following the above condition.
Use your file handling concepts to take the input from a file “q1_input.txt” and display the
output in “q1_output.txt”

Problem: 6
Given a string of random letters, you need to examine each.
Some letters naturally have 'rings' in them. 'O' is an obvious example, but 'b', 'p', 'e', 'A', etc
are all just as applicable. 'B' even has two rings.
Your job is to count those letters that have no rings and divide the total number by 2. Round
the answer down. Once you have your final score:
if the score is 1 or less, return 'Not even a medal!'; if the score is 2, return 'Bronze!'; if the
score is 3, return 'Silver!'; if the score is more than 3, return 'Gold!’.
