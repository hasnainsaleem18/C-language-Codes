Problem: 1
Write a program in which user will enter his name. The name will be passed
to a function which will check whether the string was palindrome or not and display a
message accordingly.
Note: A string is said to be palindrome if it remains the same on reading from both ends. It means that
when you reverse a given string, it should be the same as the original string.

Problem: 2
Write a C program that does the following according to user input. Itâ€™s a
menu-driven program. The user is asked to enter a string. Then the program
displays the following menu:
A) Count the number of vowels in the string
B) Count both the vowels and consonants in the string
C) Display the most frequent character in the string.
D) Concatenate another string with the existing string.
E) Exit the program.
The program performs the operation selected by the user and repeats until
the user selects E to exit the program.

Problem: 3
A software house is looking for a programmer to write a program that does encryption and decryption
of a message to securely transmit it over the network. Be the one who will write that program. Write a
C program that takes a string as an input (including spaces). The string will be passed to a function
named encrypt () as an argument. The function will encrypt the string and displays the encrypted
version of the message. There should be another function named decrypt (), which will decrypt the
message and displays the original message. Your program should be menu driven.
Implement Caesar cipher algorithm in a way that each character in the
original string should be replaced by its succeeding third letter.
