This repository contains a set of C programs addressing various tasks. Each program is designed to perform specific operations, such as finding the largest integer, checking even/odd numbers, calculating attendance for exam eligibility, determining leap years, and more.

1. Find the Largest Integer:
   Reads two integers from the user.
   Outputs the largest one using if-else statements.
2. Check Even or Odd:
    Reads an integer from the user.
    Outputs whether the number is even or odd using if-else.
3. Find the Largest Among Three:
    Reads three integers from the user.
    Outputs the largest one.
4. Attendance Check for Exam Eligibility:
    Asks the user for the total number of classes scheduled and attended.
    Passes these values to a function calculateAttendance.
    Calculates attendance, displays it, and decides if the student is allowed to sit in the exam.
5. Leap Year Checker:
    Asks the user to enter a year.
    Passes the year to the function isLeap which checks if it's a leap year or not.
    Prints the result.
6. Cookie Shipping Calculation:
    Prompts the user to enter the total number of cookies, cookies in a box, and boxes in a container.
    Outputs the number of boxes and containers needed to ship the cookies.
    Handles leftover cookies and boxes.
7. Earthquake Magnitude Descriptor:
    Reads magnitude from the user.
    Displays a meaningful message about the earthquake magnitude.
8. Largest Odd Number Checker:
    Examines three variables (x, y, z).
    Prints the largest odd number among them or a message if none are odd.
