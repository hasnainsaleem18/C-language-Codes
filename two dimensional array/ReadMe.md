Problem: 1 
Write a program which input a 2-Dimensional array of size 3x4, find the largest element in it

Problem: 2
Write a C Program to Find the Transpose of a Matrix.
The program takes a matrix and prints the transpose of the matrix. In a transpose matrix, rows
become columns and vice versa.
Expected Output :
The matrix is :
1 2
3 4
The transpose of a matrix is :
1 3
2 4

Problem: 3 
Write a program which input a 2-Dimensional array of size 3x3, find the sum of diagonals of a matrix.
Expected Output :
The matrix is :

1 2 5
3 4 7
6 3 8
Addition of the Diagonal elements is :13

Problem: 4 
Write a function find_small_val(int A[] ) that given an array A of N integers, returns the
smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
For example, given A = {1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2}, the function should return 5.
Given A = {1, 2, 3}, the function should return 4.
Given A = {-1, -3}, the function should return 1.
Write a program for the following assumptions.
Each element of array A is an integer within the range
[-1,000,000...1,000,000].

Problem: 5
Write a program to declare an array of size 7, initialize the array with the user provided values (using
scanf) and display the second minimum value in the array.

Problem: 6
Write a program that simulates the rolling of two dice. The program should
use rand to roll the first die and should use rand again to roll the second die. The sum of the
two values should then be calculated. [Note: Each die can show an integer value from 1 to 6, so
the sum of the two values will vary from 2 to 12, with 7 being the most frequent sum and 2 and
12 being the least frequent sums.] Figure shows the 36 possible combinations of the two dice.
Your program should roll the two dice 1,000 times. Use a one-dimensional array to tally the
numbers of times each possible sum appears. Print the result count.
