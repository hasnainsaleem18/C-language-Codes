1. pattern1:
    Write a C program that prints the following patterns separately one below the other.
    Use nested for loop to generate the patterns.
    Sample Output:
    *****
    ****
    ***
    **
    *

    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****

2. pattern2:
    Write a C function to construct the following pattern, using a for loop. User should enter a symbol e.g
    *,^,@,- etc, and your function should a pattern like this of that symbol

3. series:
    Write a Program that takes ‘n’ and ‘x’ from user and computes the series.

4. perfect:
    A “Perfect” number is a positive whole number that is the sum of its proper divisors (including 1 and
    excluding the number itself).

5. cricket match
    Suppose there is a cricket match between Pakistan and India. India played first and gave a
    target of 300 runs to Pakistan. Now write a program that obtains a cricket match score and
    remaining wickets from user. If the score is greater than 300 outputs a message indicating
    “Pakistan win the match by X wickets” while X are remaining wickets. Otherwise shows a
    message how many remaining runs required to win with X wickets in hand. Use single if-else
    statement. If score is 300 with 0 wickets in hand then display match is draw.

6. palindrome
    A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when digits are reversed.
    The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
    Write an efficient program that Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit
    numbers.

7. triangle
    Write a program that will display the first five triangular numbers to have over 10 divisors.
    Display the triangular number with their all divisors as shown above.

8. pattern
    Write programs to display each of the following patterns.
    (i)
    1
    2 2
    3 3 3
