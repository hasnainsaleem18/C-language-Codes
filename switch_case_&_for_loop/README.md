This repository contains a set of C programs addressing various mathematical operations. Each program is designed to perform specific tasks, such as checking if an alphabet is a vowel or consonant, displaying factors of an integer, calculating the factorial of a number using both for loop and recursion, and calculating Combination (nCr). Additionally, there is a program to display prime numbers within a given range.

1. Check Vowel or Consonant:
    Asks the user to input an alphabet.
    Determines whether the input is a vowel or consonant.
2. Display Factors of an Integer:
    Accepts an integer from the user.
    Displays its factors.
3. Calculate Factorial:
    Asks the user to input a number.
    Solves using two methods: For Loop and Recursion.
    For Loop Method: 
        Calculates and prints the factorial using a loop.
    Recursion Method: 
        Uses recursion to calculate and print the factorial.
4. Calculate Combination (nCr):
    Takes the values of n and r from the user in the main function.
    Contains a function to calculate Combination (nCr) and return it to the main.
    Prints the value of nCr in the main function.
5. Display Prime Numbers:
    Takes two numbers from the user.
    Displays all prime numbers between the given range.
6. Random Walk:
    1. Report the total distance traveled.
    2. Report the total number of steps.
    3. Report the average distance traveled per step. (Make sure that the case of zero steps and zero
    distance traveled does not cause problems.)
